## Problem Statement
    A consumer finance company specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 

    The data given is given for past loan applicants whose loan was approved and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Decision making risks :

Two types of risks are associated with bank decision.
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company. 
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

# Analysis Approach

1. Exploratory data analysis on the data set.      
2. Data Understanding
    Address Quality issues
    Handle outliers
3. Data cleaning and manipulation.    
    Format the data based on data types like date, float, int.   
    Derive columns based on the existing columns. 
4. Data analysis
    Univariate analysis
    Bivaraiate analysis
5. Conclusions
    Conclusion based on patterns and drivers.

# Technologies used

1. Numpy and pandas for vector and matrix computation
2. Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for data vizualization

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
